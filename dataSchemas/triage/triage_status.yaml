## A new triage status timestamp should be automatically updated with each new entry into the patient record if the entry is an input for a triage score.

# LIFE Score ================================================================================================
# Requires NISS and RTS scores


# RTS =======================================================================================================
# Requires GCS, SBP, RR  NOTE if not available directly then there are a few options...
# - GCS can be inferred via communication with ISOP...Q: "Do they appear coherent?", then GCS = 13-15, "Is their speech slurred?", then GCS = 8-12
# - SBP and RR can be estimated via casualty simulation data based on known injuries, specific ISOP physiology, and known interventions
# - RR can be validated via communication with ISOP...Q: "Count your breaths for 30 sec and let me know what you get..." or Q: "What does their breathing sound like?" [normal, rapid and shallow, difficult and raspy, etc]

# NISS ======================================================================================================
# Requires Insult Type, Location, AIS
#     - "Describe your injuries. Include the type of injury, the location, and severity."
